A wide range of data types and variables may be useful in predicting cancer subtype. These include both non-genetic and genetic data. This project is aimed at determining the relative value for these different data types on predicting metastatic breast cancer subtype. Non-genetic data includes a wide range of diagnostic (e.g. hormone levels, tumor size, number of lymph nodes, location of metastasis) and patient/demographic (e.g. age, race, etc.) information. The genetic data provided is based on copy number alterations (CNA), that provides gene-level data on the occurence and type of genetic mutation. Sequencing of dignostic biopsies from cancer tumors can be easily done and the applicability of CNA for stratifying tumor subtypes provides a rich source of data for analysis (2). While thousands of genes are involved in underlying molecular and signaling pathways, with many potentially mutated, emerging throughput sequencing techniques allow to systematically analyze differences and similarities between tumors on the basis of their genetic trait (3). It will be especially relevant to see whether certain genes act as influential tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, which can potentially explain phenotypic variation.
