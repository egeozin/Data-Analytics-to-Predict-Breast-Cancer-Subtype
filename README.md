Cancers are predominantly characterized by mutations within the genome. Almost no tumors have the exact same mutation profile, giving rise to multiple cancer subtypes with diverse clinical outcomes. This makes cancer both complex and heterogeneous, with added difficulty to determine which treatments patients will be most responsive to and the eventual outcome of the pathology. In an effort to better understand the molecular processes driving tumor progression, multiple initiatives such as the  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have sought to gather multi-omic (genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, etc.) data to build profiles for thousands of tumors and enable stratification based on clinically and biologically meaningful subtypes. While this has been limited by the availability to extract relevant information from data, efforts have been made to link mutation profiles with gene interaction networks. This allows to use variable selection methods, clustering, network smoothing and other methods to analyze mutation profiles in the context of prior knowledge on molecular pathways in order to label tumors into specific subtypes in ways that inform both understanding of the underlying biologic network leading to disease progression and clinically relevant treatment options.
