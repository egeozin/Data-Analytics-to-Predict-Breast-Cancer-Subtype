#A unique sample identifier.	Identifier to uniquely specify a patient.	Oncotree Code	Sample sequential timepoint (T1 = timepoint 1, T2 = timepoint 2, etc.)	Calculated variable that is set to YES if a sample was taken prior to the start of any medical therapy	Calculated variable to classify if samples were taken while the patient had metastatic disease, or prior to metastatic disease. Samples taken less than 4 months prior to the diagnosis of metastatic disease are classified as METASTATIC DISEASE PRESENT	Sample collection time in days from primary diagnosis 	The location in the body where the biopsy or surgery was performed	Left or right sidedness for breast procedures	The procedure performed to obtain the sample	The sample's histology reported in the pathology report (IDC = Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, ILC = Invasive Lobular Carcinoma).	Notes if Ductal Carcinoma In Situ was reported in the pathology report	Notes if Lobular Carcinoma In Situ was reported in the pathology report	Sample grade reported in the pathology report 	Estrogen Receptor (ER) status reported in the pathology report	Percentage of Estrogen Receptor (ER) reported in the pathology report. A value of >= 1% indicates an ER Positive tumor.	Progesterone Receptor (PR) status as reported in the pathology report 	Progesterone Receptor (PR) percentage reported in the pathology report. A value of >=1% indicates a PR Positive tumor.	HER2 status reported in the pathology report	HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results in the pathology report. This test involves staining tissue samples and looking at them under a microscope to determine if the HER2 protein is overexpressed in the sample. Results can be reported as 0+, 1+, 2+, or 3+. 0+ and 1+ indicate a HER2 negative tumor, 2+ is considered equivocal and may require further testing, and 3+ indicates a HER2 Positive tumor.	HER2 Flourescence In Situ Hyrbridization (FISH) results in the pathology report. This is most commonly performed on tumor samples with a HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 2+, or equivocal. This is an additional test that aims to measure whether or not the HER2 gene is overexpressed in a tumor sample.	Ratio of HER2/CEP17 in the pathology report. This is one component of the Flourescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test. This ratio is used to determine if the HER2 gene is overexpressed, relative to the CEP17 protein, which acts as a baseline measurement. HER2/CEP17 ratios >2.2 indicate a HER2 Positive tumor.	Copy number of HER2 in the pathology report. This is the number of copies of the HER2 gene seen in the sample, which is used to calculate the HER2/CEP17 ratio. Having multiple copies of a gene means that the tumor's DNA has many consecutive repetitions of the region that codes for a given gene. Having multiple extra copies of a gene is also described as an amplification, while losing copies of a gene is described as a deletion. 	Copy number of CEP17 in the pathology report. This is the number of copies of the CEP17 gene seen in the sample, which is used to calculate the HER2/CEP17 ratio. Having multiple copies of a gene means that the tumor's DNA has many consecutive repetitions of the region that codes for a given gene. Having multiple extra copies of a gene is also described as an amplification, while losing copies of a gene is described as a deletion. 	The percentage of Ki67 reported in the pathology report	Additional information regarding the sample
